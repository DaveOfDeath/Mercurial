  text: "\"I know that the truth is fragged up, I know that much.\"\n\n\"I was a low-level manager in shipping when Aztech started showing an interest in us. The company, not me or the shipping department. They sent a hatchetman to investigate, and he spent a few days crawling through our records with his space-case secretary. Everyone was terrified of him, afraid of losing their jobs, but they were especially terrified of his masters back in Aztechnology.\""

We never got the pay or perks of Aztech employees, but suddenly we found out that we had been working for them all along.\"\n\n\"Anyway, Texamach got his. The sick fragger would bang his secretary, and who hasn\'t, but he would give it to her every night, and people heard her screaming through the office wall. Sick, right? So Texamach gets killed, his secretary gets grabbed, and whoever popped him, left him there naked with brains splattered all over the walls of his hotel room.\""

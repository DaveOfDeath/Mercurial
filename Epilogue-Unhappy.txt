ROCKER QUEEN IN BTL SCANDAL!
By D Hendrix

According to reliable sources, Maria Mercurial was inducted into the Betty Ford Rehab center in CalFree today, for treatment after a reaction to BTL chips. Rumors have long existed that Mercurial has had a history of BTL Dreamchip abuse, although no one has ever come forward with definitive proof- until now. Since the supicious deaths of Armando Hernandez and Max Foley last year. Speculation that Mercurial herself was involved in the deaths led to investigations but no charges. 

The Seattle brach of Citizens for Decent Society Policlub announced an immediate UCAS congressional inquiry into the matter. In a statement released just hours ago, CFDS chairwoman Margot Tipper says "Do we really want such people as role models for our children? Taking drugs, burning BTLs, murdering people and living lascivious lifestles while they preach to overthrow our great corporate culture in their nefarous music' what kind of decent woman does things like that?"

Maria Mercurial reached star status with the multiplantinum release of her hit single "Who Weeps for the Children?" before falling into obscurity after susicious death of her managers.

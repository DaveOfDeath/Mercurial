According to reliable sources, Maria Mercurial was inducted into the Betty Ford Rehab center in CalFree today, for treatment after a reaction to BTL chips. Rumors have long existed that Mercurial had a history of BTL Dreamchip abuse, although no one has ever come forward until now. 

Since the supicious deaths of Armando Hernandez and Max Foley last year, Mercurial herself has become a recluse, cancelling all tours and public appearances. Speculation that Mercurial herself was involved in the deaths led to investigation, but no charges have been filed. 

Citizens for Decent Society Policlub chairwoman Margot Tipper announced a UCAS congressional inquiry into the matter. In a statement released just hours ago, Tipper says "Do we really these people as role models for our children? Taking drugs, burning BTLs, murdering people and living lascivious lifestyles, while preaching to overthrow our great corporations and law-based cultures? What woman does things like that?"

Maria Mercurial reached star status with the multiplantinum release of her hit single "Who Weeps for the Children?" before falling into obscurity.

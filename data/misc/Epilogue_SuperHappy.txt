Rockstar Maria Mercurial today cancelled several tours dates, and scheduled appearances for the coming year. Notification continued that every ticket holder would recieve a full refund, and many fans have been promised signed posters and music chips as compensation.

At 0900 Pacific Standard time, the two were married in a simple ceremony attended by friends. "We need some time to be by ourselves. We have been given a precious gift, and we want time together to appreciate it. Our thanks to everyone who made this day possible, especially the people who helped us get to this point. Gracias."

Unable to speak, it simply acknowledges you and turns to the tidbits being sold.\n\nThe spirit showcases its wares with grand gestures and a syrupy onslaught of fragrance, and spends several minutes boastfully showcasing the various candles, spray cans, and discarded flowers that could be yours. A vase of half-wilted roses, and a dead fish, are among the wares. \n\nConvinced that it has you awestruck, it then leans back and crosses its arms shrewdly, awaiting your offer."

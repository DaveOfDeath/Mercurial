  text: "She played her first set right here in this club, in \'47.  Her agent then was Armando Hernadez, and he camped in Murdoch\'s waiting room for a week, trying to get him to set up an audition.  But wow, when Sidney heard her sing, that was all it took.  He booker her on an open contract, for as long as she wanted to stay.   Six weeks later, she got her first recording contract and the rest, like they say, is history.   But she never forgets her friends, like you cadn see here tonight.  She could pull down a drekload of nuyen playing at the Dome or some other big hall, but she comes to Seattle and plays a place like Underworld instead.   That\'s class, Chummer.\n\nWhat\'s she really like?  Depends on what day it is, man.  Well, you\'ve probably read teh drek they shovel out on ethe rocker channels.  She\'s got problems, more than most.  One minutes, she\'s the rocker queen to the max, hard and super-hype, on hyperdrive to the nova, O.K.?  The next, she\'s locked up insider herself like some uptight biddy from the burbs.  Like she even talks different, get me?   She\'s not a total brainwipe.  I mean, she doesen\'t forget what she said or did when she changes.   Bug I\'ve seen it before.  There\'s a lot of it in the business.  That lady must have had herself a heavy habit on dreamchips.  I think she\'s gotta be clean, or that drek would have killed her by  now.   But she was jacking some bad stuff once upon a time, Chummer... Take it from someone who knows."

Well, drek, you can see why.  She\'s NovaStar, chummer.\n\nHernandez is a pretty good guy, I guess.   Quiet, unless he\'s putting on the act getting a contract signed.  He can come on pretty strong, He\'s Hispanic, y\'know?  I think he mighta moved here from Aztlan a while back, and he stilld oes the \'machismo\' thing if someone tries to push him around.\n\nI gotta say, I don\'t know what he did to hose his deal with Maria.  Maybe he just couldn\'t do enough for her career.  Her new manager, Foley, is a sleaze-bag, but he has the right connections to hype a top act the way it oughtta be.\n\nI did hear some rumblings on the street taht Hernandez was taking it pretty hard.  Maria leaving to work with Foley, I mean.  Maybe that he was gonna try and do something about it... Run some shadows in on them, y\'know?  Nuyen to nutrisoy, that\'s what Foley wants to talk to you chummers about."
